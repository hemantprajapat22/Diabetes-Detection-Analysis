# 🩺 Diabetes Detection Analysis

## 🔍 Project Description
The **Diabetes Detection Analysis** project is a data science and machine learning solution designed to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on diagnostic medical data. Using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, this project performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization to build an effective prediction system.
